* How to use hveto with burst trigger

1.  Edit burst_manual.sh
1.1 In L6, edit URL of the trigger file location.
1.2 In L3, it is recommended to rename the file name according to the trigger file property. (Job runs without doing so.)

2.  Run the script.
2.1 ./burst_manual.sh
2.2 Warning: It uses segment file. You may need to wait 9:10AM next day of the event, or edit some part.
2.3 Warning: It runs only for slag==0 events in default. There are option to use other events. 

3.  Check the output.
3.1 If the job completed successfully, you can access http://10.68.10.130/~controls/hveto/manual/${yyyy-mm-dd}_burst/ to see the result.
3.1.1 It is better to analyse more on round winner channel. If it looks not the cause of the DARM noise, please rerun hveto modifying /users/DET/tools/Hveto/etc/burst.ini by moving round winner channel to unsafe channel.
3.2 If the job failed, please check the log on the screen. The cause maybe that there is no coincident glitch.
